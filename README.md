# JEMSTONE-Proposal

This repository contains additional images for the JEMSTONE (JVLA Examinations of Massive STellar Object Natal Environments) proposal.
This repository is public and viewing/downloading the contents is anonymous.

The included images show our selected pointings in the same format as proposal Figure 4.
The KEYSTONE region W3 West is omitted as it does not contain any proposed pointings.
We generate the pointings shown with a FWHM of 2 arcmin, pointings are overlapped by 1/3 primary beam FWHM.
